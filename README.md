# Discourse - A College of Winterhold Expansion

Discourse - A College of Winterhold Expansion (DACWE) is a mod that aims to expand the College of Winterhold. It aims to give the College mages, scholars & students some more depth, as well as adding new dialogue & small quests.

I've taken all I learned from Companions Dialogue Bundle and feedback and applied it to this continuation in giving more life to the factions around Skyrim. Dawnguard Dialogue Bundle was next in line, but it was just too big to really focus on (and I was in a mage mood), so I targeted my next favorite faction, the College of Winterhold.
